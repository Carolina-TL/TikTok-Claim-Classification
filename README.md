# TikTok-Claim-Classification
Classifying TikTok videos as claims or opinions — final project for the Google Advanced Data Analytics Specialisation.

This project was developed as part of the Google Advanced Data Analytics Specialisation. The objective was to build a supervised machine learning model to classify TikTok videos as either claims or opinions. The workflow included data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), data visualisation, descriptive statistics, hypothesis testing, feature engineering (including text vectorisation), model training and evaluation using tree-based classifiers, and selecting a final model based on recall performance. The project provides insights into content moderation and the role of engagement metrics and language features in predicting factual content.

The champion achieved over 99 % in all metrics. In particular, recall was of 99.73 % and 100 % precision on test data. This means it accurately detected almost all claim videos—only 5 wrong out of 1,859—whilst no opinion videos were incorrectly flagged as claims. Engagement metrics were the strongest predictors; for example, no opinion video had more than 10,000 views. Author ban status, transcription length  and text patterns like “media claim” and “friend read” also contributed to prediction accuracy.
