However, those data do not follow normal distributions, so it's not clear why a t-test should apply to them. In fact both distributions are very skewed to the right, due to the typical behaviour of social networks, where a minority of videos get a great number of views. That's why their standard deviations, 221,139 and 325,682, correspondinly, are even greater than their means.\n",

This also means user's verified status is an important variable to keep in mind for machine learning models in our claim classification project.\n",
