The variables that don't contain null values are: #, video_id, video_duration_sec, verified_status and author_ban_status. It seems that in the cases in which there is no transcription text, reasonably, there is no claim status, but surprisingly there aren't counting of views, shares, likes, downloads or comments. In any case, there are 298 null values.The transcription texts start differently, though it seems the table is sorted by the way the text starts, for example, in the first 10 rows the constant expression is \"someone shared with me that\". Furthermore, there is not a clear organisation pattern for the other variables, except from that one.\n",

    "3. Except by the video duration, the rest of numeric variables have a standard deviation so much greater than the mean values. That shows considerably long ranges for those features. Although that could also be a sign of outliers, it's not clear if there are any yet. Besides, the data doesn't have non-sense values like a negative amount of downloads or likes, so far. However, there is a strange video of 5 seconds, which is a very short and uncommon period, and it seems it not easy to do a claim or opinion in a five seconds duration. It will be important to analyse that video and perhaps some other with very few seconds. All the video ID's have 10 digits which could potentially be a characteristic of integrity, though it will be necessary to check for duplicates."
